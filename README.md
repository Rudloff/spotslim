# SpotSlim

SpotSlim is an open source Spotify client written with web technologies.

It uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and the [Web Playback SDK](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/).

## Proprietary libs

Unfortunately, we have to use the `spotify-player.js` library which is not open source.
All the code in this repository is free though.
